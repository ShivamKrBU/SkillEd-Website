# React + Vite

This project is set up to quickly get you started with building React applications using Vite. Below are the steps to get started:

## Installation

First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, clone this repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

Next, install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Code Formatting

We use Prettier along with ESLint to maintain consistent code formatting. It's recommended to install the Prettier extension in your code editor for a better development experience.

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start Vite's development server and open your default browser with the project running. You can now begin building your React application!

## Building for Production

When you're ready to build your application for production, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready build of your project in the `dist` directory.
